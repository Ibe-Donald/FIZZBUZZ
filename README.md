# FIZZBUZZ
A code that solves the FizzBuzz problem and uses the words "GIT" and "HUB" instead of "Fizz" and "Buzz". It takes an input n and outputs the numbers from 1 to n. For each multiple of 3, it prints "GIT", instead of the number. For each multiple of 5, it prints "HUB", instead of the number .For numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5, outputs "GITHUB"
